# Deep-Learning---classification-of-pizza-and-non-pizza-images-using-convolutional-neural-network
aims to classify images into two categories: pizza and non-pizza. In this project, a CNN architecture is used that is designed to recognize visual features typical of pizza images, such as shape, color, and texture, and distinguish them from non-pizza images. The dataset contains various pizza and non-pizza images to train the model to recognize relevant patterns. After training, the model was tested to evaluate its accuracy in classifying new images. This project demonstrates the ability of CNN in detecting food objects and its potential to be applied in image recognition applications in the culinary field.
